## Welcome to the project peeps!
Hope you're having a great day :D

## Essentials
Unity Editor Version: 2022.3.11f1 (LTS)
- this is the editor version you should install onto the hub
- the project in the repo was made in this version

Optional: Get Github Desktop for easiest GUI committing
- no command line :O

Folder Structure
- assets are self-explanatory (art, scripts, etc)
- there are two main scenes: Battle and Room
- everyone has their own scene (under scenes/personal)
- use your own scene to mess around and learn unity
- feel free to make your own subfolders for your assets in the asset folders
